# Taming VAEs
### Bayesian Methods of Machine Learning Course Project

Main paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00597

IWAE: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00519.pdf

##### Project Goals:
* Reproduce experiments (see Figure 2 and Figure 6) from the main paper
* Change ELBO, using IWAE bound (see the second paper)
* Repeat experiments with the new functional
* Compare the results

#### Team: Kuzina Anna, Prokopenko Denis, Shumovskaia Valentina
